Sort Stage:
1.It is a processing stage.
2.it will support 1 I/P and 1 O/P and there is no reject link.
3.To sort the data we need sort key column.
4.We can delete the duplicates in Sort stage as well in options tab: Allow Duplicates = False {Default=True}.
5.we can filter the data by enablingin options:  create key change column= yes  {Default: False} then you can connect the filter stage and we can 
  write where clause condition.
   B) We can find out the duplicates by enabling Create key change column = true. It will create new column with 'key change()'
          Key change = 1 [Unique]
		  Key change = 0 [Duplicate]
		  Ex: Ex: NO          Key cahnge           
	     10          10             1  
	     10          10             0
		 20          10             0                         
		 10          20             1                
		 20          20             0                    
		 30          30             1 
Q1) What is the difference b/w link sort and the sort stage?
Ans: link sort and sort stage functionality wise it is same but where as in sort stage we have few more options compared to link sort.
      sort
      A) when we have volume of data is more we should use sort.
	  B) We can handle Amount of memory to be used in sort default 20MB. 
Q2) what is the difference b/w remove dupliacte stage and sort stage?
Ans: In Duplicate stage we can reatin the duplicate data either first or last based on the  option:  Dupliactes retains = First(Default) or Last
     In sort stage we can reatin the data from first we don't have option to retain from last.
Q3) How many ways we can delete the duplicates?
Ans: 1.Remove duplicate stage----> based on colun and duplicates retails is first or last 2. sort stage -->options--->Allow duplicates = False 3.link sort --> partition--->perform sort enable-->unique 4.Transformer stage 5.filter stage where cluase conditon with keychange 6. sequential file -->fileter
-->unix command [sort -u] 7. DB ---> select distinct column name from table name
